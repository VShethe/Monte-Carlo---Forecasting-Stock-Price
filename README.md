## Project Description

1. **Monte Carlo - Predicting Gross Profit**
Monte Carlo simulation can be used to predict gross profit by generating multiple random simulations of the variables that affect gross profit, such as sales revenue, cost of goods sold (COGS), and selling and administrative expenses.

To use Monte Carlo simulation for predicting gross profit, you would first need to specify a model that describes the relationship between these variables. 

```bash
 One common model is the following equation:

 Gross_Profit = rev + COGS

```
